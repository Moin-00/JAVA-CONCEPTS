There are two ways to create String objects.
1. Using new keyword. -> It creates two object. One in heap and one in string constant pool
if string constant pool doesn't contain same string object.
        String name = new String("Vikram");


2. Using string literal.
        String name2 = "Vivek";//"Vivek" is string literal
